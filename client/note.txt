Redux setup

-- The Redux itself is an independent peace of software, we use react-redux to link them with react
-- The Redux tools of google chrome cannot read the value of redux app automatically, we need to set it up

--> 2 things to set up besides the main redux things

-- create a store.js to create the store for redux
-- import store, and redux Provider to app.js => make like the Context API
-- in Reducer, make index.js as the root reducer to gather all reducer, it uses CombineReducer
-- create Actions

-- Then anytime you want to use that peace of global state, use {connect} from 'react-redux'
-- we have to import that function, connect that function at the export, then it becomes a props, so we have to put
   it in the props before using it. 
-- if use an action in another action => import the function and dispatch(function())
-- if use in the main level, where store is used, import the function and use store.dispatch(functions())

-- the process is Actions --> Reducer --> result --> then come back to the UI to call that action
